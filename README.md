<img src="/img/render.png" alt="Render of the Case" width="800">

## Overview

This is a 3D-printed case designed for the XL6019 step-up converter. The XL6019 is a high-efficiency DC-DC boost converter module capable of stepping up voltage for various applications. It is widely used by hobbyists and makers for powering devices that require higher voltages than the input source provides. 

The case offers protection for the circuit, enhances portability, and features a clean, simple design suitable for hobbyists and makers. The case is particularly useful for those building secondary step-up converters for projects such as powering lamps or other devices.

## Features

- **Two-part design**: Includes a box and a lid.
- **Ventilation slots**: Located on the lid to help dissipate heat.
- **Cable holes**:
  - Input hole for power (e.g., USB cable).
  - Output hole for the converted current (e.g., to power devices like the IKEA NAVLINGE lamp).
- **Secure fastening**: Requires 4 M3 screws to assemble.

## Materials

- Recommended materials: **PLA** or **PETG**.
- For higher current applications, **PETG** is preferred due to better heat resistance.

## Assembly

1. Print the case parts using the provided STL files.
2. Place the XL6019 module inside the box.
3. Align the lid with the box and secure them together using 4 M3 screws.
4. Route the input and output cables through the designated holes.

## Usage

This case is ideal for projects requiring a secondary step-up converter. Its design ensures durability while maintaining ventilation for safe operation.
